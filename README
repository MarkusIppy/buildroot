This is a fork of the Jumpnow buildroot config adapted to build a dedicated image for PowerTune 

How to build your PowerTune image (PI3 only )


Open a terminal in Linux 

$ git clone https://github.com/MarkusIppy/buildroot.git
$ cd buildroot
$ make powertune_rpi3_defconfig
If you use another screen than the official pi Screen , edit the following file 
$ nano /buildroot/board/powertune/rpi3/rootfs/profile.d/qt5-env.sh

Press "Ctrl+x" when you finished modifing the file and plress "y" to save

$ make



This will download all required sourcecode into a seperate folder called "dl"
Once the compilation has finished it will create a pi image called "powertune.img" in the folder
/buildroot/output/images

Flash the image to your SD card ( you can user Etcher or do it via command Line ) 
Etcher can be downloaded her https://etcher.io/

The image currently has a boot time of approx 17 seconds until PowerTune is starting ( i am still working on optimization ) 

About the image :
The username and password are :

user: root
pw: root

Not all linux commands are supported and there is no need to use sudo 

Should you wish to use Wlan :

quit powertune 

login with username and password

Type the following :

$nano /etc/network/wpa_supplicant.conf

Enter your WLAN SSID and Password 

Press "Ctrl+x" then press "y" to save

$reboot

Now your pi will always log into WLAN at boot
