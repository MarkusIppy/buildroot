Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on Freenode IRC.

How to build your PowerTune image (Pi2 & PI3 only )


Open a terminal in Linux 

$ git clone -b MarkusIppy https://github.com/MarkusIppy/buildroot
$ cd buildroot
$ make powertune_rpi3_defconfig
$ make

This will download all required sourcecode into a seperate folder called "dl"
Once the compilation has finished it will create a pi image called "powertune.img" in the folder
/buildroot/output/images

Flash the image to your SD card ( you can user Etcher or do it via command Line ) 
Etcher can be downloaded her https://etcher.io/

The image currently has a boot time of approx 17 seconds until PowerTune is starting ( i am still working on optimization ) 

About the image :
all Boot messages are redirected to tty3 so the screen stays blank .
If you quit powertune you will only see a blank screen . 
Press Alt +F3 to see the terminal.

The username and password are :

user: root
pw: powertune

I would love if someone can make some optimization to get the boot time to arround 5 seconds from powerup
